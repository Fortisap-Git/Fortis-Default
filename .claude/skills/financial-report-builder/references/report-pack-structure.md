# Report pack structure

Anatomy of the Fortis "Financial Reports" pack as issued from Xero report
templates, captured from the five 2025/2026 packs. `render_pack.py` reproduces
this page for page; `assets/boilerplate.json` holds the wording.

## Page order (default)

| # | Page | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Cover** | "Financial Reports" (blue, bold) · entity name · "ABN xx xxx xxx xxx" · "For the year ended 30 June 20XX" · "Prepared by Fortis Accounting Partners". No footer. |
| 2 | **Contents** | One line per report, in print order. No footer. |
| 3 | **Profit and Loss Statement** | Columns `2026 | 2025`. |
| 4 | **Balance Sheet** | "As at 30 June 2026"; columns `NOTES | 30 JUNE 2026 | 30 JUNE 2025`. |
| 5 | **Movements in Equity** | Columns `2026 | 2025`. (Frontier prints this *before* the Balance Sheet - `options.report_order`.) |
| 6+ | **Notes to the Financial Statements** | Note 1 policies, then numbered Notes each with its own `2026 | 2025` header. |
| … | **Depreciation Schedule** / **Accounting Depreciation Schedule** | Only when a schedule is supplied. Landscape for the register / standard layouts. |
| … | **Directors Declaration** | Signature block per director + Dated. |
| last | **Compilation Report** | APES 315 wording, signed John Kalachian. |

Every page from the P&L onwards carries the footer
`Financial Reports | <Entity>` (left) and `Page x of y` (right). Continuation
pages repeat the report title in small type at the top left and the column
header row of the table.

Footnotes above the footer rule:

* Statements (P&L, BS, depreciation schedule): *"The accompanying notes form
  part of these financial statements. These statements should be read in
  conjunction with the attached compilation report."*
* Notes pages: *"These notes should be read in conjunction with the attached
  compilation report."*
* Movements in Equity, Declaration, Compilation Report: none.

## Balance Sheet layout

Several Balance Sheet lines can point at the **same Note** (Payables,
Personnel-related items and Taxation all reference the Payables note).

## Movements in Equity layout

```

    Retained Earnings                ← residual direct posting (Frontier (125,000))
    Other Increases / any supplied movement
    Total Increases

```

## Notes layout

**Note 1 - Statement of Significant Accounting Policies**: paragraphs (a) basis
of preparation incl. AASB 1031 and AASB 110, (b) Property, Plant and Equipment,
(c) Inventories. Wisdom IT and Complex (no stock) still print (c); Frontier does
not - controlled by `options.include_inventory_policy` (default: only when an
Inventory note exists). Extra policies can be switched on via
`options.extra_policies` (income_tax, revenue, gst, employee_benefits,
foreign_currency).

**Notes 2+**: each note starts with a `2026 | 2025` header, then the title
(`3. Receivables`), tiers, and `Total <Note title>`.

| Note | Tier structure |
|---|---|
| Cash and Cash Equivalents | Bank Accounts / Other Cash Items → `Total Bank Accounts` … |
| Receivables, Financial Assets, Financial Liabilities, Other Assets/Liabilities | Current / Non Current (Financial Liabilities adds Secured / Unsecured under Non Current) |
| Inventory | Inventories |
| Property Plant and Equipment | one tier per class: cost line, accumulated depreciation line, `Total <class>` |
| Intangibles | Goodwill / Other Intangible Assets |
| Payables | Current → Personnel-related items → Tax liabilities (→ Financial Liabilities in the Wisdom variant), each with a total |
| Provisions, Loan from Shareholders/Associates, Prepayments, Investments | flat list |

## Depreciation schedule layouts

| `layout` | Title | Columns | Orientation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `simple` | Accounting Depreciation Schedule | NAME · COST · OPENING VALUE · PURCHASES · DISPOSALS · DEPRECIATION · CLOSING VALUE | portrait (Wisdom) |
| `standard` | Depreciation Schedule | NAME · RATE · METHOD · PURCHASED · COST · OPENING VALUE · PURCHASES · DISPOSALS · DEPRECIATION · CLOSING VALUE | landscape (Padel) |
| `register` | Depreciation Schedule | NAME · ASSET NUMBER · ASSET TYPE · PURCHASED · COST · OPENING ACCUM DEP · OPENING VALUE · PURCHASES · DISPOSALS · DEPRECIATION · CLOSING ACCUM DEP · CLOSING VALUE · EFFECTIVE LIFE · DEP START DATE | landscape (Frontier) |

Assets are grouped by class with `Total <class>` rows and a grand `Total`. Set
`depreciation.orientation` to force portrait/landscape.

**Input file** for `build_pack.py --depreciation`: CSV with a `group` column and
any of `name, asset_number, asset_type, rate, method, purchased, cost,
opening_accum, opening_value, purchases, disposals, depreciation, closing_accum,
closing_value, effective_life, dep_start`; the layout is inferred from the
columns present (or a JSON file in the pack format). Export it from the
workpaper's `Accounting Depn` tab or the client's asset register.

Ties checked: Σ depreciation = P&L depreciation/amortisation/write-off lines;
Σ closing value = Property, Plant and Equipment note (current year).

## Directors Declaration

Plural wording (2+ directors) or singular wording (1 director) from
`boilerplate.json`. Paragraph 1 refers to "30 June 20XX" - **derived from
`entity.fy_end`**, never typed. One `Director: ______` block per name in
`entity.directors`, then `Dated: ______`. Signing happens later through FuseSign
(the Frontier pack carries the FuseSign audit trail as extra pages).

## Compilation Report

"Compilation report to <Entity>" → paragraph 1 (balance sheet as at
<fy_long>) → *The Responsibility of the Directors* → *Our Responsibility*
(APES 315, APES 110) → *Assurance Disclaimer* → signature block:
John Kalachian / Fortis Accounting Partners / Chartered Accountants / Suite 9
Level 12 101 Bathurst Street / SYDNEY NSW 2000 / Dated. Singular "director"
wording for a sole director.

## Errors in the source packs the generator must not repeat

These slipped through in the example packs because the templates were edited by
hand. The engine derives every date and name from `entity`, so they cannot recur:

| Pack | Slip |
|---|---|
| Complex Communicators 2026 | Directors Declaration says "as at 30 June **2025**"; "Board of Director". |
| Frontier Travel 2026 | Compilation Report says "balance sheet as at 30 June **2025**"; Note 1 heading "Accounting Policie"; asset type "Office Equiepement". |
| Padel Point 2026 | Declaration starts "he directors"; "Capital Loss Resreve"; entity printed as "Padel Point Pty Ltd." on some pages and without the full stop on others. |
| Wisdom IT 2026 | Payables note prints "Total Financial Liabilities" for what is the note total. |

## Naming and filing

File name: `YYYY Financial Report - <Entity Name>.pdf` (FY year, e.g.
`2026 Financial Report - Padel Point Pty Ltd.pdf`). FYI: cabinet **Final Reports
& Returns**, categories **Year = 20XX** and **Final Reports Category = Annual
Return/Financials**, linked to the entity and, where one exists, the annual
compliance job.
