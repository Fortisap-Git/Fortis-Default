## Regression run

```bash
cd .claude/skills/financial-report-builder
for f in assets/examples/*.json; do python3 scripts/render_pack.py "$f" "/tmp/$(basename "$f" .json).pdf"; done
```

Expected: no ERROR rows; Frontier shows the WARNING for the (125,000) retained
earnings movement; page counts 11 / 9 / 10 / 13 / 14 (the generator's tables run
slightly longer than Xero's).
